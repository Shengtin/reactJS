<p>Think about the things you can do on Facebook newsfeed page: infinite scrolling, liking and sharing posts, commenting, chat with friends, etc. Technically, the Facebook newsfeed page itself is basically an app, a <strong>Single Page App</strong>.</p>
<p>Single Page Apps are different from the more traditional multi-page apps that you see everywhere. The biggest difference is that navigating a SPA doesn't involve going to an entirely new page. Instead, your pages load inline within the same page itself:</p>

<p>We are going to learn most of the React fundamentals by an app called Nextagram.<br>It's a very basic version of Instagram where you get to see pictures uploaded by all users.</p>
<p>Let's get started by generating a new react app using <code>create-react-app</code>.</p>
<p>You may run <code>npx create-react-app react-nextagram</code>.</p>
<p>Or if you have installed <em>creact-react-app</em> into your machine through <code>npm i -g create-react-app</code>, then you may run <code>create-react-app react-nextagram</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to take a look at the API endpoints.</p>
